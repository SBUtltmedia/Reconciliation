# Redirects index.html to secure no matter what...
# B/c base index is index.html - so a visit to stonybrook.edu/marginalia/ will force shibboleth login.
# Even if https is already on, we still do shibboleth b/c we might not be logged in...
# Whereas the above rule is only if https:// isn't on to begin with...
# The problem with these 2 rules -
# Edge Case where: https:// is on, and we visit index.htm directly.
# AND it's a new browser session/no cookies are saved.
# Basically, we'll be in https://...index.htm but all our API requests will fail - b/c we aren't technically 
# logged in via Shibboleth. (so, we need to write some javascript to check whether shibboleth requests are logged in)
# and if they aren't - then force the user to https://shibboleth/index.html to login
# See: Shibboleth.js for dealing with the edge case.
