            "Intro": "Mrs. Gerralto is a 76yo F with history of COPD (on 2L home O2), T2DM, HLD, and GERD who presents to the ED with 5 days of worsening shortness of breath, fatigue, and cough with increased white sputum. She has required 4L of O2 via her nasal cannula during this time. She denies any sick contacts but does volunteer as a receptionist at the nearby assisted living facility. She ran out of her Symbicort 10 days ago and has not yet been able to meet with her physician to renew her prescription. On review of systems, she denies any chills, malaise, chest pain, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or dysuria. She is afebrile, and saturating 90% on 4L nasal cannula. On exam, she is in mild respiratory distress with diffuse expiratory wheezes. She has no leukocytosis and no consolidation on chest x-ray. She is started on methylprednisolone IV and albuterol nebulizers in the ED, with improvement in her symptoms. She is admitted to medicine for further evaluation.",
            "Name": "Susan Gerralto\n",
            "Synopsis": "As the admitting team, you start the patient on azithromycin, albuterol nebulizers q6h, and prednisone 40mg daily. Her outpatient oral diabetes regimen will be converted to sliding scale insulin. During her hospital course, her breathing, wheezing, and cough improve. Her oxygen requirements are weaned down to her home level of 2L. On day 3, Mrs. Gerralto is ready to be discharged home. She will need enough azithromycin to complete a 5 day course (500mg day one, 250mg thereafter), and a 5 day prednisone course of 40mg once daily. Please refill or continue her home medications as appropriate."

            "Intro": "Mr. Bates is a 40 year old male admitted to the hospital after he developed significant acute on chronic right leg pain and swelling. He has history significant for right lower extremity paralysis and chronic pain on oxycodone associated with injury during service in British Army, as well as T2 NIDDM with A1c of 7.5. During admission he was found to have a acute right femoral deep vein thrombosis confirmed with bilateral lower extremity venous doppler ultrasound. He had no other risk factors for DVT except for immobility.",
            "Name": "John Bates",
            "Synopsis": "Mr. Bates' right leg pain improved with more frequent doses of oxycodone and intensive physical therapy while in the hospital. After PARQ conferences he opted for warfarin for chronic anticoagulation, and agrees to lovenox for bridging therapy. You agreed to bridge his warfarin for 5 more days with lovenox after he demonstrated stable INR for 2 days on warfarin. You also reminded him to be seen in the anticoagulation clinic as soon as possible to have routine INR checks and warfarin dosing adjustment. He requested a new prescription of oxycodone at higher doses and frequency because he is still having pain and he is almost running out of his home prescription, however you suspect he is not tolerating higher doses because his nurse reports that he was more somnolent at 15mgs and sometimes gets confused with Q4H dosing. In addition, his hospital lantus is to be discontinued and he will resume home metformin on discharge."
