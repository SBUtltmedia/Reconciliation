She was admitted to the hospital after after becoming increasingly short of breath. She was treated for an exacerbation of heart failure with additional diuretics (water pill). An ECHO was performed which showed an EF of 45% which is unchanged from your baseline. It was determined that the exacerbation was related to dietary non-compliance with salt and fluids. During her hospital stay she were switched from her home NPH to Insulin Glargine (Lantus) based on hospital formulary. Her water pill (Lasix) was increased from 20 mg to 40 mg daily.",

He requested a new prescription of oxycodone at higher doses and frequency because he is still having pain and he is almost running out of his home prescription, however you suspect he is not tolerating higher doses because his nurse reports that he was more somnolent at 15mgs and sometimes gets confused with Q4H dosing.

        "Welcome to the medication reconcillation simulation. Each of these exercises will present you with a clinical vignette and provide you with direction to make changes to medication orders.\nYou will get two tries, and your responses will be locked in afterwards.\nThe purpose is to create a EHR agnostic experience that will hopefully help you learn how to make sure you order medications correctly when you start your internship. Good luck!"
