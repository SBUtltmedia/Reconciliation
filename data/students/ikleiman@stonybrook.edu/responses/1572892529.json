Given that the patient was on metformin at home, she should have her home metformin continued. She should not have been prescribed aspart insulin at home because she has no supplies, would require education, and her current condition does not warrant it. \nHer cholesterol medication was overerdosed, and she returns with myalgias. She requires that her home regimen of atorvastatin be continued. \nHer reflux medication was overdosed, and she returns with a headache. She requires that her home regimen of famotidine be continued. \nHer Symbicort was overdosed, and she returns with a headache. The inciting event for the patient's exacerbation was the lack of her home Symbicort prescription. Without a new refill she would quickly return to the clinic with worsening symptoms. \nHer Azithromycin was overdosed, and she develops QTc prolongation. The azithromycin course is 5 days. Day 1 is 500mg, and then 250mg once daily thereafter for 4 days. The patient was discharged on hospital Day 3, so she received the first 3 days of the treatment course. The remaining 2 days would be 2 doses of 250mg once daily. \n","correct":false,"submitted_time":"2019-11-04","elapsed_time_sec":14,"submission":{"group_1":{"Metformin_Home":{"amt":"1000","action":"continue"},"Aspart Insulin_Hospital":{"amt":"4000","action":"modify"}},"group_2":{"ProAir HFA (Albuterol MDI Inhaler)_Home":{"amt":"90","action":"continue"},"Albuterol Nebulizer Solution_Hospital":{"amt":"0","action":"stop"}},"group_3":{"Atorvastatin_Home":{"amt":"80","action":"modify"},"Atorvastatin_Hospital":{"amt":"20","action":"modify"}},"group_4":{"Famotidine_Home":{"amt":"20","action":"modify"},"Famotidine_Hospital":{"amt":"80","action":"modify"}},"group_5":{"Symbicort (Budesonide\/ Formoterol)_Home":{"amt":"160","action":"modify"},"Symbicort (Budesonide\/ Formoterol)_Hospital":{"amt":"320","action":"modify"}},"group_6":{"Azithromycin_Hospital":{"amt":"750","action":"modify"}},"group_7":{"Prednisone_Hospital":{"amt":"80","action":"modify"}}},"submit_amt":{"group_1":5000,"group_2":90,"group_3":100,"group_4":100,"group_5":480,"group_6":750,"group_7":80},"actual_amt":{"group_1":1000,"group_2":90,"group_3":40,"group_4":40,"group_5":320,"group_6":500,"group_7":80}}
